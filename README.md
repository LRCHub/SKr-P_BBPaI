[00:04.91] (Wait)
[00:07.91] 
[00:06.47] People love the boxes they put me in
[00:08.41] Thinkin' they can put a pink bow on it to fix things (uh)
[00:11.86] Cut out all the pieces that just don't fit
[00:13.98] Isn't it weird no one else thinks it's toxic? (Uh)
[00:38.98] 
[00:17.19] Wasteland, they're starin'
[00:19.58] Feel the heat when I'm walkin' right past them
[00:22.10] I'm cravin' interaction
[00:24.83] Everywhere, the clouds of dust block my vision
[00:47.83] 
[00:27.71] God, it's so hot
[00:29.71] So hard to breathe
[00:31.68] And I try to run
[00:33.20] I wanna be free
[00:35.45] (Ay, they've reached me)
[00:47.45] 
[00:38.55] I can move a mountain range, I don't need magic
[00:41.95] We're just on another plane, you don't understand it
[00:45.25] I could make the world change, start a new planet
[00:48.68] But they can't stand it
[01:00.18] 
[00:50.42] Reality hurts
[00:57.42] Reality hurts
[01:03.92] 
[01:05.24] Dirt stuck to my feet, they keep on chasin' me
[01:08.58] They can't catch up to me, I leave them in the dust, like
[01:12.03] Oh, I think I've chewed enough, reality is tough
[01:15.90] I try to bite but I can't seem to get through it
[01:39.90] 
[01:18.72] (Uh) I don't want that
[01:20.43] (Uh) I don't need that
[01:22.18] (Uh) 'cause I'm with my girlies, yeah
[01:40.68] 
[01:25.77] I can move a mountain range, I don't need magic
[01:29.15] We're just on another plane, you don't understand it
[01:32.69] I could make the world change, start a new planet
[01:35.83] But they can't stand it
[01:47.33] 
[01:37.97] Reality hurts
[01:44.66] Reality hurts
[01:51.16] 
[01:53.35] We keep rock and rollin' 'cause we're always gonna
[01:55.93] Bounce back, bounce back, bounce back, keep it goin'
[02:00.05] I'm the antibody, yeah, I'm always gonna
[02:02.64] Bounce back, bounce back, bounce back, oh, you know it
[02:29.64] 
[02:06.50] I can move a mountain range, I don't need magic
[02:09.86] We're just on another plane, you don't understand it
[02:13.27] I could make the world change, start a new planet
[02:16.51] But they can't stand it
[02:28.01] 
[02:18.58] Reality hurts
[02:25.46] Reality hurts
[02:31.96] 
[02:32.32] (Reality hurts, babe)
